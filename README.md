Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) represent a new era of tools for code development and debug, and are pushing out legacy software development environments in Vim and Emacs. However, why limit using these tools exclusively in the software world? When in fact the benefits of using a GUI based development environment for HDL programming has a direct impact on the hardware development and verification effort required. This paper illustrates the advantages of using SystemVerilog IDEs which, when properly employed, can help decrease debug and turnaround times related to code compilation and simulation, improve code readability, comprehension and maintainability, and boost productivity.
